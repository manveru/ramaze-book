= Middleware

Ramaze relies to great extend on so-called middleware, that are small pieces of
code chained together with a simple interface to handle requests and serve
responses. The concept of middlewares was introduced by WSGI, and consequently
also used in the design of Rack.
There are already lots of middlewares available for different purposes, from
serving static files to handling authentication.

== Building middleware

An example for a middleware would be:

[source,ruby]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
class Smile
  def initialize(app)
    @app = app
  end

  def call(env)
    status, header, body = @app.call(env)
    header['Content-Type'] = 'text/plain'
    header['Content-Length'] = '2'
    return status, header, [':)']
  end
end
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This discards any response body it receives and replaces it with a smiley. Of
course that's a rather silly example, but it shows you the basic structure. A
middleware has to respond to `#call`, just like a Proc.
That's the reason why a small functional application you can run on Rack may
even look like following:

[source,ruby]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
app = lambda{|env|                                            # <1>
  [200,                                                       # <2>
    {'Content-Type' => 'text/plain, 'Content-Length' => '2'}, # <3>
    [':)']] }                                                 # <4>

Rack::Handler::WEBrick.run(app, :Port => 7000)                # <5>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this case we don't even bother with an inner application, so this is not a
middleware but an endpoint.
Using the curry functionality of Ruby 1.9, we can even make a middleware out of
a normal Proc.

[source,ruby]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hello = lambda{|env| [200, {}, ['Hello', 'World', '!']] }

reverse_middleware = lambda{|app, env|
  status, header, body = app.call(env)
  new_body = []
  body.each{|a| new_body << a.to_s.reverse }
  new_body.reverse!
  [status, header, new_body]
}

app = reverse_middleware.curry[hello]

Rack::Handler::WEBrick.run(app, :Port => 7000)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This would return a body containing '!dlroWolleH', it's almost equivalent with
the `Smile` middleware we built above, but works completely without creating a
class.

NOTE: Yukihiro Matsumoto sees the Proc#curry method as a curiosity at best.
      I don't think I can agree with that.


== Ramaze modes

As said above, Ramaze uses a lot of middleware to provide flexible functionality
that can be maintained, improved, or replaced independently without even
touching the Ramaze codebase.

The simplest way to do this is to change the so-called `mode` Ramaze runs in. A
`mode` describes a set of middlewares and gives it a unique name.

At the moment there are only two modes builtin: `:live` and `:dev`, the `:dev`
mode is the default and should be changed upon (or before) deployment as it has
a huge impact on the overall performance of Ramaze.

This option can be changed via `Ramaze.options.mode`, changing it will trigger
an internal rebuild of the Dispatcher, so you can switch between modes during
runtime, although this might be used only rarely it can be useful for example to
adapt your application to peak-load by changing to a more aggressive caching
strategy.

It is recommended that you maintain your own set of middlewares for larger
applications so you can influence the behaviour better. We will show later how
to do this in just a few lines of code.

The harder part of using your own set of middlewares is in figuring out which
functionality you need and in which order it should be applied, something we
will try to help you with as well.

=== The :dev and :live modes

In `:dev` mode, short for 'development mode', Ramaze will try to make your
developing as effortless as possible.
It automatically reloads your source code in the background on requests, and
validates your application's behaviour against the Rack specification using
`Rack::Lint`.

This may not sound like much, but `Rack::Lint` alone usually causes a major
impact in performance (your application might run around 2-3x slower).
Once your application is developed, you can disable this functionality safely.

In case you do some really crazy things with Ramaze, you should implement this
while using the Lint to ensure conformance to the spec and avoid trouble during
deployment.
Once you are ready to deploy, Lint will have made sure that you can do safely
and won't hit any problems.

Although the source-code reloaders are built to perform as well as possible,
they still have a noticeable impact and increase the amount of disk I/O
significantly.
You certainly don't want to have your hardware die earlier on you than
necessary, so we recommend to avoid source-reloading when you don't use it.

The middlewares used during `:dev` mode are:

* `Rack::Lint`
* `Rack::CommonLogger`
* `Ramaze::Reloader`
* `Rack::ShowStatus`
* `Rack::RouteExceptions`
* `Rack::Head`
* `Rack::ETag`
* `Rack::ConditionalGet`
* `Rack::ContentLength`

The middlewares used during `:live` mode are:

* `m.use Rack::CommonLogger`
* `m.use Rack::RouteExceptions`
* `m.use Rack::ShowStatus`
* `m.use Rack::ShowExceptions`
* `m.use Rack::Head`
* `m.use Rack::ETag`
* `m.use Rack::ConditionalGet`
* `m.use Rack::ContentLength`

=== Your own modes

As mentioned above, add your own modes is a piece of cake once you know how it's
being done. Let me illustrate that with a little example of an anonymous mode.

[source,ruby]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ramaze.start do |mode|
  mode.use Rack::CommonLogger
  mode.use Rack::ShowStatus
  mode.use Rack::RouteExceptions
  mode.use Rack::Head
  mode.use Rack::ETag
  mode.use Rack::ConditionalGet
  mode.use Rack::ContentLength
  mode.run Ramaze::AppMap
end
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an exact replica of the `:live` mode, but now you can shuffle
middlewares around, insert other ones you like or need, or remove some you won't
need.

If you want to keep a couple of middlewares handy for fast switching you can
give them names, that's just as easy, I'll skip the actual mode of the block,
it's indentical to the above example using `Ramaze::start`:

[source,ruby]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ramaze.middleware :moon do |mode|
  # ...
end

Ramaze.middleware :earth do |mode|
  # ...
end

Ramaze.middleware :mars do |mode|
  # ...
end

Ramaze.options.mode = :earth
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that we have multiple modes in place we can freely switch between them and
tweak each as we need.


== Rack middleware

The two main repositories with middlewares ready to use are the {www-rack} and
{github-rack-contrib} projects.
Obviously, all the middlewares in Rack are available to you out of the box, as
Ramaze depends on it, but many more are in rack-contrib, and you can simply
install the 'rack-contrib' gem and `require 'rack/contrib'` in your application.

As the number of middlewares is constantly growing, I'll just present you with
some that are commonly used, and leave it up to you to discover more.

=== Rack::Lint

Lint validates your application and the requests and responses according to the
Rack spec.
The current Rack spec can always be found on the Rack homepage or may be
generated by issuing `rake SPEC` in the Rack source.

The spec covers aspects like valid response body, correct response status,
proper response headers, etc.
The full spec with some annotations can be found in the Rack chapter.

=== Rack::CommonLogger

The CommonLogger middleware forwards every request to the given app, and logs a
line in the Apache common log format to the given logger, or `rack.logger` by
default.

In Ramaze we pass `Ramaze::Log`, an instance of `Ramaze::LogHub`, so we
integrate cleanly with any middleware that is not aware of Ramaze logging.

An example of the log output would be:

[source,txt]
